# Chen's Bootcamp Blog

Hello all! 

Welcome to my blog where I will be documenting my journey through the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. 
My name is Jia-Yi (Jacob) Chen and I am a UKY '19 Computer Science graduate with a bit of post-grad experience in education. 
I joined this bootcamp with the desire to learn the intricacies of web development beyond what I learned during my undergrad and also as a coding refresher. 
Here, I hope to keep a weekly-updated log of my experiences, excitements, frustrations, and evertyhing else in between. Thank you for reading and enjoy!

## Week 3: JavaScript
_Learning JavaScript and creating my first webpage_

### Onboarding: Sprint 3

_Questions for the blog:_
> What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

On the one hand, it's nice having each part of the webpage on its own file--structure on one, style on another, and function on a third. It makes it somewhat easier to identify where an issue might be coming from. On the other hand, there's a much higher learning curve. I feel like you have to keep your skill in each area at the same level to really flesh out a good webpage.

> What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

My blog has only incorporates collapsible sections so far. I've been meaning to add pictures though.

> What are your thoughts on pseudo coding?

I think pseudo coding is beneficial. It's helpful to physically plan out your process rather than just jump straight into it. Especially with coding. More often than not, I run into some issue and after taking time to fix it, I forgot why I had the issue in the first place. I certainly don't pseudocode as much as I should.

  ## Week 2: HTML & CSS
  _Reviewing HTML & CSS and structuring content on a webpage_

  ### Onboarding: Sprint 2

  _Questions for the blog:_
  > What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

  Create a webpage with really nice buttons. Webpages I have made in the past have always seemed "choppy" due the buttons being square and unresponsive.
  I don't really know how to explain it, but sometimes you can feel how well-made a webpage is by how well the buttons and clickable things work.

  > What are you struggling with?

  Staying motivated. I get excited starting out every day but lose that motivation quickly after only a few minutes of getting into the readings or videos.
  I think this stems from the content being a mix of things I'm familiar with and things that are new. I'm excited to learn new things but get bored when reviewing things I have seen before.
  I just have to stay focused on the long-term and pushing through.

  > How do you solve a problem? What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?

  In this field, I feel like most problems one might run into have been ran into before by someone else. So, my first step is always a quick google, and this usually gets me unstuck. If I am still stuck, I try to reach out to people that have been stuck in my situation before for advice.

  ## Week 1: _Git_-R-Done
  _Finishing pre-work and onto onboarding--starting with a (re-)introduction into version control._

  The first official week of the bootcamp, "Onboarding: Sprint 1" is complete and I gotta say, I have learned a lot.

  ### 1. Pre-Work   
  Before the start of the first week, our assignment was to complete the "Pre-Work", a number of modules containing videos, small coding tasks, and readings aimed at introducing the world of Computer Science. I am a bit of a procrastinator, so the work that was supposed to be done before this week naturally became part of this week. 
  Full disclosure: after starting the pre-work early-on and recognizing it as "easy" content that I had learned before in college, I put it aside thinking I could come back to it and would be able to catch-up quickly. **Big Mistake.** 
  I did come back to it eventually, but I did not catch up quickly. There were several more videos loaded into the last few modules that I didn't expect. The difficiulty here was having to watch all the videos I was behind on in quick succession. 
  If you've every had to watch hours of content not for the purpose of entertainment, it can be quite a drag. I thought about skipping through them, but I'm glad I didn't. 
  The videos, a series called "Crash Course Computer Science", were incredibly informative. It was all the important bits of computer science history, a timeline of how technology developed into the computers and computer components we have today, and how all those parts work. 
  I thought this was super cool to learn. One of my favorite things to do is figure how things work. Thinking back, I never had a CS class that focused on computer science history and how it all played out into what we have today, so the series was a delight. 
  There were a few bits that were reminders of college contents, but overall, the series caters incredibly well to both new and old computer scientists.
  > Crash Course Computer Science: **9/10**.

  Another part of the Pre-Work was (re-)learning some coding fundamentals using an app called Grasshopper. Having a coding background, this was easier for me to get through but not very exciting. As an app designed for beginners learning to code, it focuses on being multi-platform friendly with a lot of buttons to press instead of code to type. This is great for beginners learning basic coding concepts but not great for actually practicing code. I would be interested to see what its mored advanced modules are like.
  > Fundamentals with Grasshopper: **6/10**.

  The last part of the Pre-Work was reading the beginning chapters of a book called *The Pragmatic Programmer*. This has been a *fantastic* read so far. The book seems to focus on good practices and tips for being an effective and "pragmatic" programmer, and it does a great job. I will admit that after the first chapter, I went ahead and bought a physical copy that I could read without looking at a screen (because in this field, we do that enough). I'm excited to see what else the book has to offer.
  > *The Pragmatic Programmer*: **10/10**.

  I was able to finish the pre-work about halfway through the week and have even read ahead a little in the book. Next step, Onboarding!

  ### 2. Onboarding: Sprint 1
  The main focus of this week has been to complete our first Onboarding sprint. This sprint focused on learning version control and the fundamentals of git and GitHub, and introduced our first project, creating this blog (which seems to be going well so far)! 
  In college, I can think of only one project where I actually needed to use git, which is a shockingly low number considering version control is a necessity in a team environment and millions of developers and major tech companies maintain their software using GitHub (according to the GitHub website). 
  On top of that, none of my classes taught how to use git; its normally a solo-adventure. Needless to say, I never got to fully use git and all its features, so getting to learn all of the basics of it and its functionalities has been helpful and fun.

  _Questions for the blog:_
  > Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

  Yes and no. Yes in that my expectations were based on friends who had taken this bootcamp in the past; I had a good understanding of what I was in for and how it might've started out. No in that Justin and Ian are much friendlier and accommodating than I had expected. They create a positive, nonjudgmental learning environment, and I am eager to see how the rest of the weeks will play out with them at the helm!

  > What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

  So far, my web development experience consists of only using HTML and CSS, and maybe a little bit of PHP and JavaScript. I'm excited to learn about the additional developer tools and packages we will be using and how they will be used.

  > What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

  Something I get asked a lot is how I went from graduating with a Computer Science degree to teaching at the [#2 Best Private Elementary School in the US.](http://blog.thelexingtonschool.org/2015/10/20/the-lexington-school-named-in-best-private-elementary-schools/) 
  During my undergrad, I spent a lot of time working at [Newton's Attic](https://newtonsattic.com/index.php) (NA), an educational nonprofit that focuses on stimulating youth interests in science and engineering. 
  I instucted for many summer camp classes (Intro to Python Coding, Nerf Gun Mods, Rocket Dragsters, etc.) and field trip activities. 
  A couple years ago, The Lexington School (TLS), where several NA students attended, reached out to NA to fill a Computer Science teacher position. 
  I got recommended and ended up teaching full time, not just in Computer Science, but also in math and elementary science. As much as I enjoy teaching, it's and incredibly stressful field to get thrown into without much experience, so I decided to take a step back and learn more about the field I started with, which brings me to the bootcamp today!

# Chen's Bootcamp Blog



Hello all! 

Welcome to my blog where I will be documenting my journey through the Awesome Inc Web Developer Bootcamp. My name is Jia-Yi (Jacob) Chen and I am a UKY '19 Computer Science graduate with a bit of post-grad experience in education. I joined this bootcamp with the desire to learn the intricacies of web development beyond what I learned during my undergrad and also as a coding refresher. Here, I hope to keep a weekly-updated log of my experiences, excitements, frustrations, and evertyhing else in between. Thank you for reading and enjoy!

## Week 1: Git-R-Done
*Finishing pre-work and onto onboarding--starting with a (re-)introduction into version control.*

The first official week of the bootcamp, "Onboarding: Sprint 1" is complete and I gotta say, I have learned a lot.

### 1. Pre-Work   
Before the start of the first week, our assignment was to complete the "Pre-Work", a number of modules containing videos, small coding tasks, and readings aimed at introducing the world of Computer Science. I am a bit of a procrastinator, so the work that was supposed to be done before this week naturally became part of this week. 
Full disclosure: after starting the pre-work early-on and recognizing it as "easy" content that I had learned before in college, I put it aside thinking I could come back to it and would be able to catch-up quickly. **Big Mistake.** 
I did come back to it eventually, but I did not catch up quickly. There were several more videos loaded into the last few modules that I didn't expect. The difficiulty here was having to watch all the videos I was behind on in quick succession. 
If you've every had to watch hours of content not for the purpose of entertainment, it can be quite a drag. I thought about skipping through them, but I'm glad I didn't. 
The videos, a series called "Crash Course Computer Science", were incredibly informative. It was all the important bits of computer science history, a timeline of how technology developed into the computers and computer components we have today, and how all those parts work. 
I thought this was super cool to learn. One of my favorite things to do is figure how things work. Thinking back, I never had a CS class that focused on computer science history and how it all played out into what we have today, so the series was a delight. 
There were a few bits that were reminders of college contents, but overall, the series caters incredibly well to both new and old computer scientists.

Another part of the Pre-Work was (re-)learning some coding fundamentals using an app called Grasshopper. Having a coding background, this was easier for me to get through but not very exciting. As an app designed for beginners learning to code, it focuses on being multi-platform friendly with a lot of buttons to press instead of code to type. This is great for beginners learning basic coding concepts but not great for actually practicing code. I would be interested to see what its mored advanced modules are like.
> Fundamentals with Grasshopper: **6/10**.

The last part of the Pre-Work was reading the beginning chapters of a book called *The Pragmatic Programmer*. This has been a *fantastic* read so far. The book seems to focus on good practices and tips for being an effective and "pragmatic" programmer, and it does a great job. I will admit that after the first chapter, I went ahead and bought a physical copy that I could read without looking at a screen (because in this field, we do that enough). I'm excited to see what else the book has to offer.

I was able to finish the pre-work about halfway through the week and have even read ahead a little in the book. Next step, Onboarding!

### 2. Onboarding: Sprint 1
The main focus of this week has been to complete our first Onboarding sprint. This sprint focused on learning version control and the fundamentals of git and GitHub, and introduced our first project, creating this blog (which seems to be going well so far)! 
In college, I can think of only one project where I actually needed to use git, which is a shockingly low number considering version control is a necessity among group work and millions of developers and major tech companies maintain their software using GitHub (according to the GitHub website).
